"""Per-user filter-panel section preference API coverage.

A signed-in member (admin *or* recruiter) can read and write which
"初筛条件板块" (filter panel sections) stay visible under
``/v1/settings/filter-sections``. Like the display-field preference it is
per ``(user_id, organization_id)``; an empty selection keeps the panel's
product default of showing every section.
