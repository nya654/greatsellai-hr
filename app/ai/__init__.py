"""Vendor-neutral AI gateway contracts and protocol adapters.

This package intentionally contains no business prompts, candidate facts, or
provider-specific configuration.  Business services construct a
``CompletionRequest``; the gateway resolves the actual ``RouteTarget`` before
an adapter is allowed to make a network request.
