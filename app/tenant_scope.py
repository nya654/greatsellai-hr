"""Database-session workspace boundaries for recruiting business data.

The authenticated request selects a workspace on the server, then records it
on the SQLAlchemy session.  Every ORM read of a tenant-owned root is filtered
by that value and every write is stamped or verified before it reaches the
database.  This gives services a defence-in-depth boundary even when a future
endpoint forgets to add a manual ``organization_id`` predicate.

The legacy workspace is deliberately the safe fallback for unscoped internal
sessions.  It preserves existing service-level tests and, more importantly,
means an accidentally unscoped query can see only legacy records rather than
all customers' data.  Public requests always receive an explicit scope from
the authentication dependency.
