"""Per-user initial-filter panel section preference.

Revision ID: 20260806_0063
Revises: 20260806_0062
Create Date: 2026-08-07

Adds a filter_section_keys JSON array to the existing per-user filter
preference row so the same (user, organization) scope that already holds the
result-table column selection can also hold which "初筛条件板块" sections the
filter panel keeps visible. Existing rows backfill to an empty array, which is
the "show every section" product default.
